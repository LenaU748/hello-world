# hello-world
Just a tutorial
Hi, I'm Lena, the most amazing(and funniest) gal of them all. I'm in a programming gang, but our captain is a bit jumpy. Thank God we always have a knight who will save the day. We also have a very abnormal girl, along with an outstaning junior too. One guy is just ridiculous and everyone else is just kinda there...
This is soooooo cool...and I am so cringy!
